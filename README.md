What is Middleeartthcoin?
----------------

Middleearthcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Middleearthcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Middleearthcoin is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Middleearthcoin client software, see http://middleearthcoin.com.
